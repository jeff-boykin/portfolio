## Pre-Course

#### Prerequisite(s)

In order to make sure that students are best prepared for the first few weeks of class, we require that students have a basic knowledge of the following topics:

- How to use a computer
- How to type on a keyboard

Aside from those basic requirements:

- Students should own their own computer (a recent Mac is preferred).
- Students should own at least one iOS device for testing (but it is not required).
- Students should complete prework and enroll in Apple's developer program.

**Please Note**
- Students do **not** need to be existing developers in order to enroll in this program!

#### On-Boarding Task

In order to make sure that students are best prepared for the first few weeks of class, we require that students complete the on-boarding task, which can be found [here](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/iosi-precourse-onboarding). The on-boarding task covers the following topics:

* Navigating via the command line
* Git/GitHub
* Xcode & Swift Fundamentals
* Mobile Networks Architecture 101
* Apple & iOS tech and UI basics

### Holidays

Does the holiday schedule mean that your class is going to be behind schedule? Not to worry. Here are some tips that can help ensure that you cover all the material provided:

- Assign some of the labs and exercises as homework.
- Get started on a project during class so that students can complete the it over the holidays.
- Scaffold the capstone project earlier on that even if you miss a week of course because of the break, you can still cover the rest of the material.
- And last, make sure you're on schedule and not behind. The earlier you keep the better to make sure you're on track to getting through all the material before the class ends.

*Reminder: Immersives get days get added to the course to take into account for holidays, so don't worry about having to restructure the course or tag on extra days!*
